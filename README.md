React Router is a standard library used for client-side routing in React applications.

It enables navigation between different components without reloading the page.

Uses URL-based routing to create single-page applications (SPAs).

Core components include BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link, and NavLink.

Supports dynamic routing using URL parameters.

Allows nested routes for complex layouts.

Provides hooks like useParams, useNavigate, and useLocation.

Improves user experience by maintaining app state during navigation.

Easily integrates with modern React projects.
